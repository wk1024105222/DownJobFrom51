						我们主要开发硬盘类的工具软件，大家可以百度一下PC3000，是一款俄罗斯的硬盘维修软件，目前国内还没有同类软件。我们现在正开发一款类似的产品，也是为了填补国产软件的这一空白。 现招聘C++程序员，欢迎对此项目感兴趣的朋友加入我们。一、要求如下： 1. 熟悉VS2008开发环境，熟悉C++ / MFC编程。工具软件大多用C++来编写，我们也是如此。我们开发的工具软件运行在Windows平台上，因此使用的VS2008开发环境。另外，需要熟悉MFC框架，我们的产品基于此框架。我们对“熟悉C++”的定义是：当需要完成一个功能时，能够很好地用C++来表达自己内心所想。即是，面对一个具体的需求时，能够知道这个需求能不能用代码实现，该怎样用代码实现，心里能有一个比较清晰的思路。2.有过独立开发经验，或自由程序员经验，或者写过自己的小软件、小作品。这一条是指，你曾经自己搞定过一个软件的开发，或者说，你已经有一些写程序的经验了。可以对照看看下面更具体的：（1） 如果你是应届生，那么你是否以前就接触过编程？在课余时间之外你就对编程感兴趣，经常自己捣鼓一些代码，编程中有什么问题会上百度或CSDN查阅资料，经常独立就可以解决。你在CSDN上已经积累了一些技术分了，并且你也加入了几个编程QQ群，你有时候遇到问题需要请教别人，有时候也能帮别人解决问题。你自己编制过一些程序，上传到网站上或与朋友分享，并以此为乐。有时候沉迷于Code的乐趣，会忘了吃饭。（2） 你在学校参与过团队设计或期末课程设计，你作为主力编码人员，最终设计中很大一部分代码是你编写的。学校的程序开发期末课程设计经常要求一个小组协作完成，通常是那么一两个很会写代码的同学完成了小组设计中的大部分工作。如果你就是那个很会写代码的同学，那么你应该知道我在说什么 ^_^（3） 你有过在威客网站（比如猪八戒威客网）或者QQ群中，或者通过朋友介绍，接到程序设计的活儿的经历。这些程序设计任务可能是各种各样的，有些领域可能你并不完全熟悉，不过，经过摸索，你还是搞定了，并且最终完成了任务。（4） 你在公司中参与过项目开发，并且是主力程序员。（5） 你做过一些免费或共享程序，或者写过一些有趣的小软件、小作品。如果以上有至少一条符合你的情况，那么，你将应该能胜任此工作。3.有较良好的基础知识。基础知识是指：数据结构、计算机组成原理、操作系统原理、汇编语言。这些是学校里的专业基础课程，不要觉得基础课程很枯燥，没有用。实际上对基础知识的掌握对我们的工作会起到潜移默化的作用。对于C++程序员，不熟悉这些知识可能并不会马上对当前工作产生什么影响，但是在未来的某个时刻，它们必定会局限你。二、对以下技术有所了解者优先：除了基本要求，如果你对以下技术有一定的掌握，将会被优先考虑。1. Windows驱动编程。Windows下驱动程序的编写一般基于WDM或WDF框架，驱动开发涉及到对驱动模型的理解，对内核函数的了解等，如果具有windows驱动开发能力将会被优先考虑。因为我们在软件开发中会涉及到驱动程序开发。2. 逆向调试技术。了解常见的软件调试技术，熟悉反汇编，会使用OD、IDA等工具者，会被优先考虑。3. 熟悉文件系统结构/硬盘相关原理。熟悉FAT32文件系统、NTFS文件系统数据结构的，熟悉硬盘工具软件相关技术的，将优先考虑。我们的工具中也需要开发文件系统解析引擎。4. 熟悉嵌入式开发，ARM开发的。了解ARM反汇编的。硬盘固件也是基于嵌入式系统。所以，了解嵌入式开发将有助于工作。三、工作具体将做些什么？程序员将负责我们的硬盘工具软件的代码编写和维护，并进行一些技术研究。具体来说，工作主要分为文件系统组和固件系统组。文件系统组方面的工作是编写和维护文件系统解析引擎，会包括编写搜索丢失分区表，恢复误删文件之类的功能。需要了解文件系统的结构，比如要对FAT32和NTFS文件系统有一定的了解。实际上，不需要对细节太过了解，因为具体的细节可以查找资料获得，关键是对文件系统的原理和设计思想要有一个很好地认识。固件系统组方面的工作就是编写固件专修工具。需要了解具体硬盘的固件结构。比如，负责希捷固件专修工具的程序员，则需要学习希捷硬盘的固件结构。这个过程有点类似学习一个新的操作系统。打开Windows任务管理器，看看里面的进程列表，csrss.exe，smss.exe，winlogon.exe，这些进程都是做什么用的？如果你全都能说出来，恭喜，至少你对windows还是有点了解的。硬盘固件与此类似，如果你打开固件列表，能够清楚的知道每个模块都是做什么用途的，损坏了会导致什么后果，那么你已经有点了解了。在此基础上，就可以编写固件处理程序。通常是对一些数据结构进行处理，修改，或者显示出来，诸如此类。举个例子，你是否了解过EXE文件的PE格式，然后写出一个程序，显示出EXE文件的导入表来。或者了解BMP图像文件的格式，然后写一个解析器，将BMP文件读取并显示出来。实际上，文件系统组和固件系统组都需要经常和各种数据结构打交道，不同的是，文件系统不专注具体的硬盘，而固件系统是必须了解具体硬盘，以及硬盘的操作方式的。并且，固件组程序员，将会学习到所负责品牌的硬盘的基本维修技术。四、开发中可能接触到哪些技术？如果你是一名应届生，那么当选择加入创业型的小公司的时候，可能你会更关注在这里能学到哪些东西，以及在公司接触到的技术是不是自己所感兴趣的方向。软件开发也有很多方向，比如游戏开发、网络开发、ERP系统、地理信息、手机开发、系统安全、工具软件等等，相互之间差异很大。所以在这里我们详细描述技术方向，以便你确定是否是你感兴趣的开发方向。在开发中可能接触到的技术有：1. C++ / MFC 这个是天天都会用到的。在不断的使用中你将对一门语言越来越熟悉。2. 文件系统原理 / 文件系统解析器编写为什么误删的文件能够恢复？如何强删被系统锁定的文件？什么是主引导扇区？文件系统驱动是如何工作的？文件系统组会涉及到此领域。3. 硬盘固件结构和固件原理，各种品牌硬盘的基本维修方式。硬盘如何工作？固件损坏如何维修？操作系统是怎样访问硬盘的？固件系统组会涉及此领域。同时，学习硬盘维修也是有好处的，它会让你掌握一个编程之外的技能。4. 驱动开发技术。设备驱动是如何开发的？软件如何访问硬件？类似PC3000一样，我们的产品也包含一个硬件维修卡设备，需要插入电脑主机插槽。软件是与硬件配合使用的。因此会用到Windows下驱动开发。5. 单片机编程技术如何开发一个硬件产品？从设计到布图到制板的整个流程需要经历哪些步骤？我们的产品中包含的硬件设备是由我们自主开发的，硬件开发中会涉及到单片机编程技术。请注意一点，硬盘维修软件并非是属于内核安全的范畴，虽然它们之间可能有一点交集。我们的工作主要是软件编写和硬盘固件的分析研究。如果你是关注于内核安全、调试破解领域，我们可能就并不符合你的兴趣方向。五、详细介绍一下我们的数据恢复软件项目？我们公司主要有两项业务，一是对外从事数据恢复业务，二是从事硬盘固件维修工具软件的开发。也就是说，我们是一个数据恢复公司，一方面提供数据恢复或硬盘维修，另一方面，我们也开发自己的数据恢复软件，提供给别的数据恢复公司。数据恢复软件属于特定的行业软件。此类工具软件主要用于硬盘维修和数据恢复领域。磁盘工具软件有很多类型，常见的比如：MHDD：主要功能是扫描磁盘，检测磁盘坏道等。磁盘分区表医生：主要功能是检测与修复分区表。DiskGens：用于分区表及文件系统的检测与修复。EasyRecover：用于误删文件的恢复操作。PC3000：俄罗斯的一款工具，主要用于硬盘固件维修。效率源数据恢复软件：国产的硬盘固件维修工具。以上工具均可在百度百科了解到更详细的情况。大家可能了解到，在数据恢复或者硬盘相关工具中，现在已经有非常多的软件，而且有不少还是免费软件。但是这些工具，都是用于对硬盘用户数据区的操作。如果硬盘的固件本身遭到损坏，那么硬盘会不认盘，无法被系统识别，那么，这些工具就都无能为力了。现代的硬盘，本身实际上是一个微型计算机系统，包含CPU、内存，甚至包含专用操作系统，因此完全可以看做一台专用计算机。硬盘固件属于嵌入式开发领域，目前市面上主流的硬盘使用的CPU，大多基于ARM构架或者MIPS构架（就好比台式机大多基于x86构架一样）。硬盘上电后，内部的固件会开始启动，进行自检，载入工作程序，然后等待主机来访问它（想象台式电脑的启动过程）。如果硬盘固件损坏，那么硬盘就可能无法启动，或者工作不正常（想象一下Windows XP丢失了NTLDR之类的系统文件会怎么样）。因此，对于固件损坏的硬盘，通常主机无法识别，或者能识别但不能读取数据，这种情况下，如果不能修复固件，任何其它软件均无法对硬盘执行操作。从操作系统的观点来看，硬盘对其提供了一个平坦的存储空间，对此空间的所有操作，都是对于硬盘用户数据区的操作。用户数据区可能包含分区表，隐藏分区，加密分区，文件系统的一些表结构，或者文件的数据体，但对于硬盘来说，都是无差别的用户数据。固件损坏后，硬盘的用户区可能变得无法读取，此时，任何对于用户区进行操作的软件（无论是分区表修复工具或者普通的磁盘扫描程序）都无法再对硬盘进行任何操作。固件很容易损坏吗？（百度一下“希捷固件门”。）在硬盘损坏的情况中，平均固件问题占据70%以上，剩下的30%才是物理损坏（比如磁头损坏、电机损坏，盘片划伤等）。对于物理损坏，通常需要开盘进行处理，而对于固件损坏，其实只需要用专门的软件即可进行修复。由于固件损坏后，症状看起来非常像物理损坏，所以普通用户经常与真正的物理损坏混淆。哪些软件可以处理硬盘固件？目前数据恢复类软件非常多，但能对硬盘进行固件级操作的工具却只有两款，且价格不菲：1. PC3000。全世界都在用。它是把不同品牌的硬盘固件工具集成到一个软件中。2. 效率源系列工具。国内有不少用户。它是出了很多专修工具，一个品牌对应一个，比如西部数据专修工具、希捷专修工具。为什么硬盘固件级工具这么少？这是因为，不同硬盘的固件，都是由不同厂商自己开发的，固件系统涉及到硬盘比较核心的一些技术，在很大程度上，厂商对此都是保密的。正因此如，能处理硬盘固件的工具就非常稀少，也就导致这些工具价格昂贵。目前我们也在开发并维护一款硬盘固件修复工具软件，也就是类似PC3000那样的工具。这样以后用户就可以有除了PC3000和效率源工具之外的第三个选择。由于同类软件稀少，因此前景乐观。六、联系方式：电话：027-82621261 邮箱：2693828612@qq.com网址：http://www.mrtlab.com

职位描述：
						您可能会承担的工作：公司内部ERP软件和各类自动化软件的测试我们希望您能满足以下条件：1) 本科以上学历，计算机专业背景。2) 3年及以上测试经验, 有质量控制意识，有志于将QA作为长期事业。3) 有独立分析问题和解决问题的能力4) 具备强烈的工作责任心和主动性，敢想敢做！5) 熟悉至少一种自动化测试工具，熟悉Jenkins、Selenium、Maven等工具优先雷军说，台风来的时候，猪都会飞。现在我们这个行业就处在台风来临的前夜。我是德佑地产研发中心的宋工，人称老宋或者宋大叔。为了能吸引志同道合者加入我们，我常常绕过招聘经理，自己来写招聘广告。我讨厌那种冷冰冰的只有职责描述、任职要求的招聘启事。任何一个职位背后，一定有一家公司的愿景，一群有理想有激情的团队，以及我们为用户（客户）创造价值的使命。下面，我秉着德佑坦诚分享的价值观，来为大家介绍一下我们公司和我们研发团队。有人对传统行业公司能否做好互联网产品一直存有质疑，对技术团队在传统公司的处境和待遇颇有疑虑。我也希望借这个机会，对大家关心的问题做一个说明。同时告诉大家，来德佑做产品和研发其实是个不错的选择。1. 技术团队在德佑是否是边缘部门？在很多人的心目中，技术团队在传统公司就是边缘化的部门，或者叫做支持部门。但是事实上，工程师和产品经理在传统公司正在发挥越来越重要的作用。我们虽然身处传统行业，但是深刻地认识到信息技术对传统行业带来的深刻影响。信息技术最有施展空间的地方也恰恰是改造传统行业，使得传统行业焕发新的生命力。这就像历史上的工业革命、科技革命一样。无论是京东商城还是携程网，包括现在概念很火的O2O，都是用信息技术来改造传统行业的典型案例。随着技术的发展，例如移动互联网的发展，产品和技术的地位必将进一步增强，最终成为公司的主导。也经常有求职者问我，你们公司对IT技术重不重视？从5人到130人，你觉得公司重视不重视？^_^看你是否被重视，不必纠结于老板找你开了几次会或请你吃了几次饭，或者说了几句好听话。看你的薪水在整个公司属于什么水平，你就知道你是否被重视。2. 我们的产品有技术挑战吗？一个产品是否具有技术挑战取决于三个方面：用户量、业务逻辑、算法。多数传统行业公司在信息化上的常规做法，是采购成型的ERP、OA软件，投入再大一些的，会做一些定制开发。这种做法大大降低了公司的开发成本，降低了对技术和产品人员的要求。但是，这种产品开发方式已经越来越不能适应现今以移动和社群为主流的互联网应用环境。尤其是我们这样一个快速发展中的公司，无论是制度还是流程，都在快速“迭代”中。是的，我说得是敏捷软件开发中的那个“迭代”。目前我们整个研发团队已经完成了敏捷转型。 我们公司目前有数条产品线，每条都拥有数百万的PV。在我们的规划中，我们这些产品线将未来还有5～10倍的增长。另外，正在建设的德佑官网，将是一个日访问量千万级的网站。如何利用有限资源实现24*7的无间断服务，并让用户拥有良好的使用体验，这对从服务部署、程序架构、一直到前端页面代码，都提出不低的要求。更不要说，产品本身处在快速的迭代更新中，越来越多的用户角色被不断纳入到服务体系中。说到这里，有些朋友可能会有所不屑。PV不过亿，怎么好意思谈挑战？那我再补充一下。任何产品是否具有技术挑战，并非取决于它属于什么行业，而是取决于产品决策者究竟要做什么样的产品。要想从竞争中脱颖而出，我们同样需要前沿技术的支持。我们一年内规划中的产品功能需要应用到机器学习、大数据可视化、推荐算法、搜索引擎等相对前沿的计算机技术，我们对这方面人才可谓求贤若渴。3.我们需要什么样的人？我们需要在互联网产品、技术方面各类优秀的人。“优秀”，并不一定要求你有哪个名牌大学的学历或曾任职于什么大牌公司。“优秀”，首先要求你对所从事工作的喜爱。如果你是产品经理，说起各种网站和应用，你能如数家珍；如果你是工程师，你对自己程序的性能和质量极其挑剔；谈起新技术，两眼放光，立马想研究一下，看是否能用到自己的产品中去。“优秀”还体现在你对待工作的态度。态度认真是起码要求，一旦承诺，不打折扣执行出来。逼格装得再高一点，我一直认为，那些能做出一番事业或者做出非凡产品的人，都是有理想主义情怀的人。最近“情怀”这个词被老罗给整坏了。尽管这个时代大家喜欢自嘲，喜欢解构崇高。但我还是觉得理想主义的光辉永不磨灭。一个有情怀的人，当他遇到一时的挫折或者得失时，更能坚持自己的理想，不忘初心。无论是刚入职场的菜鸟，还是从业多年的大咖，我们都有需求。无论你什么学历、什么经历、或对薪水有什么预期，都不必忌讳，我们以完全开放的心态，期待你和我联系。4. 薪水和待遇如何？我们公司产品经理和工程师的薪资水平，绝不低于互联行业的平均水平，部分岗位还略高于平均水平。我们欢迎行业大牛，也欢迎职场菜鸟，薪水完全根据个人能力而定。有兴趣者可直接向我或者我们的HR询问。除了薪资，公司为员工提供完善保险和福利，五险一金加各种补助。另外，我们团队内部有极强的学习氛围。各种不同的兴趣小组和读书会等待你的加入。每周还有一次技术讲座，偶尔也会邀请外部讲师来跟大家交流。

						我们主要开发硬盘类的工具软件，大家可以百度一下PC3000，是一款俄罗斯的硬盘维修软件，目前国内还没有同类软件。我们现在正开发一款类似的产品，也是为了填补国产软件的这一空白。 现招聘C++程序员，欢迎对此项目感兴趣的朋友加入我们。一、要求如下：1. 熟悉VS2008开发环境，熟悉C++ / MFC编程。工具软件大多用C++来编写，我们也是如此。我们开发的工具软件运行在Windows平台上，因此使用的VS2008开发环境。另外，需要熟悉MFC框架，我们的产品基于此框架。我们对“熟悉C++”的定义是：当需要完成一个功能时，能够很好地用C++来表达自己内心所想。即是，面对一个具体的需求时，能够知道这个需求能不能用代码实现，该怎样用代码实现，心里能有一个比较清晰的思路。2.有过独立开发经验，或自由程序员经验，或者写过自己的小软件、小作品。这一条是指，你曾经自己搞定过一个软件的开发，或者说，你已经有一些写程序的经验了。可以对照看看下面更具体的：（1） 如果你是应届生，那么你是否以前就接触过编程？在课余时间之外你就对编程感兴趣，经常自己捣鼓一些代码，编程中有什么问题会上百度或CSDN查阅资料，经常独立就可以解决。你在CSDN上已经积累了一些技术分了，并且你也加入了几个编程QQ群，你有时候遇到问题需要请教别人，有时候也能帮别人解决问题。你自己编制过一些程序，上传到网站上或与朋友分享，并以此为乐。有时候沉迷于Code的乐趣，会忘了吃饭。（2） 你在学校参与过团队设计或期末课程设计，你作为主力编码人员，最终设计中很大一部分代码是你编写的。学校的程序开发期末课程设计经常要求一个小组协作完成，通常是那么一两个很会写代码的同学完成了小组设计中的大部分工作。如果你就是那个很会写代码的同学，那么你应该知道我在说什么 ^_^（3） 你有过在威客网站（比如猪八戒威客网）或者QQ群中，或者通过朋友介绍，接到程序设计的活儿的经历。这些程序设计任务可能是各种各样的，有些领域可能你并不完全熟悉，不过，经过摸索，你还是搞定了，并且最终完成了任务。（4） 你在公司中参与过项目开发，并且是主力程序员。（5） 你做过一些免费或共享程序，或者写过一些有趣的小软件、小作品。如果以上有至少一条符合你的情况，那么，你将应该能胜任此工作。3.有较良好的基础知识。基础知识是指：数据结构、计算机组成原理、操作系统原理、汇编语言。这些是学校里的专业基础课程，不要觉得基础课程很枯燥，没有用。实际上对基础知识的掌握对我们的工作会起到潜移默化的作用。对于C++程序员，不熟悉这些知识可能并不会马上对当前工作产生什么影响，但是在未来的某个时刻，它们必定会局限你。二、对以下技术有所了解者优先：除了基本要求，如果你对以下技术有一定的掌握，将会被优先考虑。1. Windows驱动编程。Windows下驱动程序的编写一般基于WDM或WDF框架，驱动开发涉及到对驱动模型的理解，对内核函数的了解等，如果具有windows驱动开发能力将会被优先考虑。因为我们在软件开发中会涉及到驱动程序开发。2. 逆向调试技术。了解常见的软件调试技术，熟悉反汇编，会使用OD、IDA等工具者，会被优先考虑。3. 熟悉文件系统结构/硬盘相关原理。熟悉FAT32文件系统、NTFS文件系统数据结构的，熟悉硬盘工具软件相关技术的，将优先考虑。我们的工具中也需要开发文件系统解析引擎。4. 熟悉嵌入式开发，ARM开发的。了解ARM反汇编的。硬盘固件也是基于嵌入式系统。所以，了解嵌入式开发将有助于工作。三、工作具体将做些什么？程序员将负责我们的硬盘工具软件的代码编写和维护，并进行一些技术研究。具体来说，工作主要分为文件系统组和固件系统组。文件系统组方面的工作是编写和维护文件系统解析引擎，会包括编写搜索丢失分区表，恢复误删文件之类的功能。需要了解文件系统的结构，比如要对FAT32和NTFS文件系统有一定的了解。实际上，不需要对细节太过了解，因为具体的细节可以查找资料获得，关键是对文件系统的原理和设计思想要有一个很好地认识。固件系统组方面的工作就是编写固件专修工具。需要了解具体硬盘的固件结构。比如，负责希捷固件专修工具的程序员，则需要学习希捷硬盘的固件结构。这个过程有点类似学习一个新的操作系统。打开Windows任务管理器，看看里面的进程列表，csrss.exe，smss.exe，winlogon.exe，这些进程都是做什么用的？如果你全都能说出来，恭喜，至少你对windows还是有点了解的。硬盘固件与此类似，如果你打开固件列表，能够清楚的知道每个模块都是做什么用途的，损坏了会导致什么后果，那么你已经有点了解了。在此基础上，就可以编写固件处理程序。通常是对一些数据结构进行处理，修改，或者显示出来，诸如此类。举个例子，你是否了解过EXE文件的PE格式，然后写出一个程序，显示出EXE文件的导入表来。或者了解BMP图像文件的格式，然后写一个解析器，将BMP文件读取并显示出来。实际上，文件系统组和固件系统组都需要经常和各种数据结构打交道，不同的是，文件系统不专注具体的硬盘，而固件系统是必须了解具体硬盘，以及硬盘的操作方式的。并且，固件组程序员，将会学习到所负责品牌的硬盘的基本维修技术。四、开发中可能接触到哪些技术？如果你是一名应届生，那么当选择加入创业型的小公司的时候，可能你会更关注在这里能学到哪些东西，以及在公司接触到的技术是不是自己所感兴趣的方向。软件开发也有很多方向，比如游戏开发、网络开发、ERP系统、地理信息、手机开发、系统安全、工具软件等等，相互之间差异很大。所以在这里我们详细描述技术方向，以便你确定是否是你感兴趣的开发方向。在开发中可能接触到的技术有：1. C++ / MFC这个是天天都会用到的。在不断的使用中你将对一门语言越来越熟悉。2. 文件系统原理 / 文件系统解析器编写为什么误删的文件能够恢复？如何强删被系统锁定的文件？什么是主引导扇区？文件系统驱动是如何工作的？文件系统组会涉及到此领域。3. 硬盘固件结构和固件原理，各种品牌硬盘的基本维修方式。硬盘如何工作？固件损坏如何维修？操作系统是怎样访问硬盘的？固件系统组会涉及此领域。同时，学习硬盘维修也是有好处的，它会让你掌握一个编程之外的技能。4. 驱动开发技术。设备驱动是如何开发的？软件如何访问硬件？类似PC3000一样，我们的产品也包含一个硬件维修卡设备，需要插入电脑主机插槽。软件是与硬件配合使用的。因此会用到Windows下驱动开发。5. 单片机编程技术如何开发一个硬件产品？从设计到布图到制板的整个流程需要经历哪些步骤？我们的产品中包含的硬件设备是由我们自主开发的，硬件开发中会涉及到单片机编程技术。请注意一点，硬盘维修软件并非是属于内核安全的范畴，虽然它们之间可能有一点交集。我们的工作主要是软件编写和硬盘固件的分析研究。如果你是关注于内核安全、调试破解领域，我们可能就并不符合你的兴趣方向。五、详细介绍一下我们的数据恢复软件项目？我们公司主要有两项业务，一是对外从事数据恢复业务，二是从事硬盘固件维修工具软件的开发。也就是说，我们是一个数据恢复公司，一方面提供数据恢复或硬盘维修，另一方面，我们也开发自己的数据恢复软件，提供给别的数据恢复公司。数据恢复软件属于特定的行业软件。此类工具软件主要用于硬盘维修和数据恢复领域。磁盘工具软件有很多类型，常见的比如：MHDD：主要功能是扫描磁盘，检测磁盘坏道等。磁盘分区表医生：主要功能是检测与修复分区表。DiskGens：用于分区表及文件系统的检测与修复。EasyRecover：用于误删文件的恢复操作。PC3000：俄罗斯的一款工具，主要用于硬盘固件维修。效率源数据恢复软件：国产的硬盘固件维修工具。以上工具均可在百度百科了解到更详细的情况。大家可能了解到，在数据恢复或者硬盘相关工具中，现在已经有非常多的软件，而且有不少还是免费软件。但是这些工具，都是用于对硬盘用户数据区的操作。如果硬盘的固件本身遭到损坏，那么硬盘会不认盘，无法被系统识别，那么，这些工具就都无能为力了。现代的硬盘，本身实际上是一个微型计算机系统，包含CPU、内存，甚至包含专用操作系统，因此完全可以看做一台专用计算机。硬盘固件属于嵌入式开发领域，目前市面上主流的硬盘使用的CPU，大多基于ARM构架或者MIPS构架（就好比台式机大多基于x86构架一样）。硬盘上电后，内部的固件会开始启动，进行自检，载入工作程序，然后等待主机来访问它（想象台式电脑的启动过程）。如果硬盘固件损坏，那么硬盘就可能无法启动，或者工作不正常（想象一下Windows XP丢失了NTLDR之类的系统文件会怎么样）。因此，对于固件损坏的硬盘，通常主机无法识别，或者能识别但不能读取数据，这种情况下，如果不能修复固件，任何其它软件均无法对硬盘执行操作。从操作系统的观点来看，硬盘对其提供了一个平坦的存储空间，对此空间的所有操作，都是对于硬盘用户数据区的操作。用户数据区可能包含分区表，隐藏分区，加密分区，文件系统的一些表结构，或者文件的数据体，但对于硬盘来说，都是无差别的用户数据。固件损坏后，硬盘的用户区可能变得无法读取，此时，任何对于用户区进行操作的软件（无论是分区表修复工具或者普通的磁盘扫描程序）都无法再对硬盘进行任何操作。固件很容易损坏吗？（百度一下“希捷固件门”。）在硬盘损坏的情况中，平均固件问题占据70%以上，剩下的30%才是物理损坏（比如磁头损坏、电机损坏，盘片划伤等）。对于物理损坏，通常需要开盘进行处理，而对于固件损坏，其实只需要用专门的软件即可进行修复。由于固件损坏后，症状看起来非常像物理损坏，所以普通用户经常与真正的物理损坏混淆。哪些软件可以处理硬盘固件？目前数据恢复类软件非常多，但能对硬盘进行固件级操作的工具却只有两款，且价格不菲：1. PC3000。全世界都在用。它是把不同品牌的硬盘固件工具集成到一个软件中。2. 效率源系列工具。国内有不少用户。它是出了很多专修工具，一个品牌对应一个，比如西部数据专修工具、希捷专修工具。为什么硬盘固件级工具这么少？这是因为，不同硬盘的固件，都是由不同厂商自己开发的，固件系统涉及到硬盘比较核心的一些技术，在很大程度上，厂商对此都是保密的。正因此如，能处理硬盘固件的工具就非常稀少，也就导致这些工具价格昂贵。目前我们也在开发并维护一款硬盘固件修复工具软件，也就是类似PC3000那样的工具。这样以后用户就可以有除了PC3000和效率源工具之外的第三个选择。由于同类软件稀少，因此前景乐观。六、联系方式：电话：027-82621261网址：http://www.mrtlab.com

						您可能会承担的工作：公司内部ERP软件和各类自动化软件的测试我们希望您能满足以下条件：1) 本科以上学历，计算机专业背景。2) 3年及以上测试经验, 有质量控制意识，有志于将QA作为长期事业。3) 有独立分析问题和解决问题的能力4) 具备强烈的工作责任心和主动性，敢想敢做！5) 熟悉至少一种自动化测试工具，熟悉Jenkins、Selenium、Maven等工具优先雷军说，台风来的时候，猪都会飞。现在我们这个行业就处在台风来临的前夜。我是德佑地产研发中心的宋工，人称老宋或者宋大叔。为了能吸引志同道合者加入我们，我常常绕过招聘经理，自己来写招聘广告。我讨厌那种冷冰冰的只有职责描述、任职要求的招聘启事。任何一个职位背后，一定有一家公司的愿景，一群有理想有激情的团队，以及我们为用户（客户）创造价值的使命。下面，我秉着德佑坦诚分享的价值观，来为大家介绍一下我们公司和我们研发团队。有人对传统行业公司能否做好互联网产品一直存有质疑，对技术团队在传统公司的处境和待遇颇有疑虑。我也希望借这个机会，对大家关心的问题做一个说明。同时告诉大家，来德佑做产品和研发其实是个不错的选择。1. 技术团队在德佑是否是边缘部门？在很多人的心目中，技术团队在传统公司就是边缘化的部门，或者叫做支持部门。但是事实上，工程师和产品经理在传统公司正在发挥越来越重要的作用。我们虽然身处传统行业，但是深刻地认识到信息技术对传统行业带来的深刻影响。信息技术最有施展空间的地方也恰恰是改造传统行业，使得传统行业焕发新的生命力。这就像历史上的工业革命、科技革命一样。无论是京东商城还是携程网，包括现在概念很火的O2O，都是用信息技术来改造传统行业的典型案例。随着技术的发展，例如移动互联网的发展，产品和技术的地位必将进一步增强，最终成为公司的主导。也经常有求职者问我，你们公司对IT技术重不重视？从5人到130人，你觉得公司重视不重视？^_^看你是否被重视，不必纠结于老板找你开了几次会或请你吃了几次饭，或者说了几句好听话。看你的薪水在整个公司属于什么水平，你就知道你是否被重视。2. 我们的产品有技术挑战吗？一个产品是否具有技术挑战取决于三个方面：用户量、业务逻辑、算法。多数传统行业公司在信息化上的常规做法，是采购成型的ERP、OA软件，投入再大一些的，会做一些定制开发。这种做法大大降低了公司的开发成本，降低了对技术和产品人员的要求。但是，这种产品开发方式已经越来越不能适应现今以移动和社群为主流的互联网应用环境。尤其是我们这样一个快速发展中的公司，无论是制度还是流程，都在快速“迭代”中。是的，我说得是敏捷软件开发中的那个“迭代”。目前我们整个研发团队已经完成了敏捷转型。我们公司目前有数条产品线，每条都拥有数百万的PV。在我们的规划中，我们这些产品线将未来还有5～10倍的增长。另外，正在建设的德佑官网，将是一个日访问量千万级的网站。如何利用有限资源实现24*7的无间断服务，并让用户拥有良好的使用体验，这对从服务部署、程序架构、一直到前端页面代码，都提出不低的要求。更不要说，产品本身处在快速的迭代更新中，越来越多的用户角色被不断纳入到服务体系中。说到这里，有些朋友可能会有所不屑。PV不过亿，怎么好意思谈挑战？那我再补充一下。任何产品是否具有技术挑战，并非取决于它属于什么行业，而是取决于产品决策者究竟要做什么样的产品。要想从竞争中脱颖而出，我们同样需要前沿技术的支持。我们一年内规划中的产品功能需要应用到机器学习、大数据可视化、推荐算法、搜索引擎等相对前沿的计算机技术，我们对这方面人才可谓求贤若渴。3.我们需要什么样的人？我们需要在互联网产品、技术方面各类优秀的人。“优秀”，并不一定要求你有哪个名牌大学的学历或曾任职于什么大牌公司。“优秀”，首先要求你对所从事工作的喜爱。如果你是产品经理，说起各种网站和应用，你能如数家珍；如果你是工程师，你对自己程序的性能和质量极其挑剔；谈起新技术，两眼放光，立马想研究一下，看是否能用到自己的产品中去。“优秀”还体现在你对待工作的态度。态度认真是起码要求，一旦承诺，不打折扣执行出来。逼格装得再高一点，我一直认为，那些能做出一番事业或者做出非凡产品的人，都是有理想主义情怀的人。最近“情怀”这个词被老罗给整坏了。尽管这个时代大家喜欢自嘲，喜欢解构崇高。但我还是觉得理想主义的光辉永不磨灭。一个有情怀的人，当他遇到一时的挫折或者得失时，更能坚持自己的理想，不忘初心。无论是刚入职场的菜鸟，还是从业多年的大咖，我们都有需求。无论你什么学历、什么经历、或对薪水有什么预期，都不必忌讳，我们以完全开放的心态，期待你和我联系。4. 薪水和待遇如何？我们公司产品经理和工程师的薪资水平，绝不低于互联行业的平均水平，部分岗位还略高于平均水平。我们欢迎行业大牛，也欢迎职场菜鸟，薪水完全根据个人能力而定。有兴趣者可直接向我或者我们的HR询问。除了薪资，公司为员工提供完善保险和福利，五险一金加各种补助。另外，我们团队内部有极强的学习氛围。各种不同的兴趣小组和读书会等待你的加入。每周还有一次技术讲座，偶尔也会邀请外部讲师来跟大家交流。
